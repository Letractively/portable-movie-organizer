A movie organizer that manages all the movies in your portable hard disk, etc. With meta data and posters.

### The Problem ###
You have a portable hard drive full of movies. But when you need to pick one out to watch
you don't know where to find.
### The Solution ###
To solve this problem I wrote this little app to organize all the movies into a database complete with information like the actors, directors, short plot and release date, rating etc. The app is designed to be run directly from the portable drive (its a portable app) so you don't have to install it on every computer you want to use it from.

Downloads are available on the left. for windows choose the file marked win. Instructions are included

### New Experimental Feature ###
Streaming movies in library to iOS devices. See [Streaming](Streaming.md).



Note: The application is still under development, so problems may occur. If you find
any problems, please notify me.
